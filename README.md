# Project Types

Types is a *potential* program in a *potential* suite of programs designed to do certain jobs in my *personal* planning system - Trips.

### Types poc - Proof Of Concept 1

This is a proof of concept for the key aspects of Types. I want to know, if I'm hypothetically able to create the app with a only reasonable amount of effort put in.

### Types poc - Proof Of Concept 2

This is gonna be a separate repo. In this Proof I want to implement the thing from Proof 1 as a ReactJS component.
