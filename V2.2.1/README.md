# V2.2.1

In this version the structure of the pointBuffer was changed, so that it only contains three Points.

===

### UPDATE

Right now I think I'm still going to implement curve smoothing, it seems possible with Bezier! ... If I can produce a a tangent to a point.

I might have to resize the buffer again, to contain all Points...  
I definitely have to add BezierControlPoints and tangent properties to the Point class.

But with that stuff **it should be possible!**
